five topics related to computing 

-Not sure if it quite counts as computing but the metaverse is an interesting topic. It reminds me of Ready Player One (the movie, I've never read the book). As much as I dislike Zuckerberg and the monopoly he is starting to have on the internet, I think the metaverse is an interesting idea/concept

-Augmented Reality is another interesting topic. It seems so basic now but I remember when the 3DS came out and it came with these Augmented Reality cards where you could use the camera on the 3DS and "see" a Nintendo character/item just chillin on the card. Nowadays with all these camera filters on social media, and Pokemon Go, MineCraft Earth, literally so many other games AR is so easy to come across. I still think it's really cool but it's crazy how far we have come with it

-Another thing I'm not sure qualifies as computing, but audio animatronics are also super cool. Like the "robots" at Disneyland on a lot of the rides. They have gotten so realistic now it is INSANE.

-Artificial Intelligence, specifically self driving cars are interesting. I'm watching a show called Upload where a man's self-driving car was hacked and crashes, killing him, which made me wonder how likely/easy that would be to happen in real life. So I guess "hackability" of AI is something of interest

-Algorithms for sorting. I'm super into Minecraft and learning about how they make automatic sorter algorithms. It's not the same as computing in real life, but algorithms can be used for so many things and I think having a bunch of things automatically sorted by a simple algorithm is pretty neat



five topics that you feel are difficult right now or topics that you think are generally difficult topics related to computer or computing,

-I'm in discrete math right now and this class seems to use a lot of that, and so far I'm kind of understanding it but it's such a different way of thinking it's a bit difficult for me now

-Artificial Intelligence I think is something difficult to do. I feel the objective of AI is to make it as "human" as possible which seems to be an extremely difficult things to do. Humans are complex creatures who are REALLY good at sensing when something is off about another human.

-This isn't an exact computing difficulty but I struggle with memorizing everything to do to code programs

-I've never tried it but programming something to do something (like a robot) seems difficult. 

-Not sure if this counts but how does programming work for people who don't know English? It seems a lot of programming languages are somewhat based off of English or at least use English words. I feel like it would be difficult learning programming without knowing or being very strong with the English language.
